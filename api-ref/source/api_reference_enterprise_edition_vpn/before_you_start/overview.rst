Overview
========

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) establishes an encrypted, Internet-based communication tunnel between your network and a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). By default, Elastic Cloud Servers (ECSs) in a VPC cannot communicate with devices in your on-premises data center or private network. To enable communication between them, you can enable a VPN.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on VPNs, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating VPNs. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0000001854089173>`.

If you plan to use APIs of the VPN service, ensure that you are familiar with concepts of VPN.
