Will I Be Notified If a VPN Connection Is Interrupted?
======================================================

The VPN connection status can be monitored. After a VPN connection is created, the VPN service reports the connection status information to Cloud Eye, but does not send alarm notifications to you. To receive notifications, create alarm rules and enable **Alarm Notification** on the Cloud Eye console.

After a VPN connection is created, you can locate the row that contains the VPN connection and choose **Operation** > **View Metric** to view the VPN connection status.
