What VPN Resources Can Be Monitored?
====================================

**VPN gateway**

The following bandwidth information of a VPN gateway IP address can be monitored: inbound traffic, inbound bandwidth, outbound traffic, outbound bandwidth, and outbound bandwidth usage.

**VPN connection**

The following information about a VPN connection can be monitored: VPN connection status, average link round-trip time (RTT), maximum link RTT, link packet loss rate, average tunnel RTT, maximum tunnel RTT, and tunnel packet loss rate.

To monitor average link RTT, maximum link RTT, link packet loss rate, average tunnel RTT, maximum tunnel RTT, and tunnel packet loss rate, click the VPN connection name and click **Add** in the **Health Check** area on the **Summary** tab page to add health check items. Private network metrics can be configured only when the VPN connection uses the static routing mode and the NQA function is enabled.
