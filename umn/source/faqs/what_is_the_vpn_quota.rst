What Is the VPN Quota?
======================

What Is a Quota?
----------------

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users. For example, the VPN quota limits the number of VPNs that you can create. You can also request more quotas if you need them.

This section describes how to view the VPN resource usage and the total quotas in a specified region.

How Do I View My Quotas?
------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. In the upper right corner of the page, click |image2|.

   The **Service Quota** page is displayed.

#. View the used and total quota of each type of resources on the displayed page.

   If a quota cannot meet service requirements, click **Increase Quota** to adjust it.

How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?
----------------------------------

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer service personnel will timely process your request for quota adjustment and inform you of the real-time progress by making a call or sending an email.

You need to prepare the following information before dialing the hotline number or sending an email:

-  Domain name, project name, and project ID, which can be obtained by performing the following operations:

   Log in to the management console using the cloud account, click the username in the upper right corner, select **My Credential** from the drop-down list, and obtain the domain name, project name, and project ID on the **My Credential** page.

-  Quota information, which includes:

   -  Service name
   -  Quota type
   -  Required quota
