Monitoring VPN
==============

Monitoring is the key to ensuring VPN performance, reliability, and availability. You can determine VPN resource usage based on monitoring data. The cloud platform provides Cloud Eye to help you obtain the running statuses of your VPNs. You can use Cloud Eye to automatically monitor VPNs in real time and manage alarms and notifications, so that you can know VPN performance metrics in a timely manner.
