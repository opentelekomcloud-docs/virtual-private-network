Application Scenarios
=====================

Hybrid Cloud Deployment
-----------------------

You can use a VPN to connect your on-premises data center to a VPC and use the elastic and fast scaling capabilities of the cloud to expand application computing capabilities. :ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0000001965006185__en-us_topic_0000001542174386_fig985610511108>` shows the hybrid cloud deployment.

Cross-Region Interconnection Between VPCs
-----------------------------------------

With VPNs, you can connect VPCs in different regions to enable connectivity between user services in these regions, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2 <en-us_topic_0000001965006185__en-us_topic_0000001542174386_fig153958299125>`.

Enterprise Branch Interconnection
---------------------------------

A VPN gateway functions as a VPN hub to connect enterprise branches, as shown in :ref:`Figure 3 <en-us_topic_0000001965006185__en-us_topic_0000001542174386_fig1582435310131>`. This eliminates the need to configure VPN connections between every two branches.

Backup Between VPN and Direct Connect
-------------------------------------

For high reliability purposes, you can connect your on-premises data center to a VPC on the cloud through Direct Connect and VPN that back up each other, as shown in :ref:`Figure 4 <en-us_topic_0000001965006185__en-us_topic_0000001542174386_fig26851202306>`.
