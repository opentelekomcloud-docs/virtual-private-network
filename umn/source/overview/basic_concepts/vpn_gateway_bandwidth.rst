VPN Gateway Bandwidth
=====================

The bandwidth you purchased for a VPN gateway refers to outbound bandwidth, that is, bandwidth for traffic sent from a VPC on the cloud to a customer gateway in an on-premises data center.

-  If the purchased bandwidth is 10 Mbit/s or less, the inbound bandwidth is limited to 10 Mbit/s.
-  If the purchased bandwidth is greater than 10 Mbit/s, the inbound bandwidth is the same as the EIP bandwidth.
