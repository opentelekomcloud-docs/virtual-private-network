Identity Authentication and Access Control
==========================================

An S2C VPN connection supports authentication of a customer gateway using a pre-shared key (PSK).

The identity authentication succeeds and the VPN connection can be set up only when the PSK configured on the customer gateway is the same as that configured for the VPN connection.
